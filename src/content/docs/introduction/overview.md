Flex is a **native mobile app** frontend-as-a-service for SAP Commerce Cloud.

The goal of Flex is to help commerce professionals build **modern, performant, and scalable** mobile apps in order to unlock B2B and B2C omni-channel use cases.

Flex aims to significantly **reduce development time** for commerce applications by giving developers a head start on core components and features, while **reducing the long term total cost of ownership** thanks to development in a **single codebase**.

- **Headless**. Flex Storefront's default integration is SAP Cloud Commerce (Hybris), but it is compatible with any backend that has an API.

- **Working Storefront**. Flex Storefront delivers fully-working eCommerce storefront, with pre-built commerce flows and core features that follow UX best practices.

- **Fully customizable**. Compose your app with pre-built Flex UI - a Flutter widget library designed for eCommerce, or build your own deisgn system from scratch.

This site contains all technical documentation related to the setup, deployment and customization of your Flex application.

Flex Storefront supports analytics events to gain valuable insights into user behavior and app performance.

By default, [Google Analytics 4](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/10089681?hl=en) is used to measure features and behaviour and generate useful reports with the provided data. The following
events are triggered automatically when using the Storefront, and can be turned off or customized inside their
[bloc, cubit or repository](../../40-state-management).

## Capturing Events within FLEX

FLEX utilizes the [Repository Design Pattern](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/repository-design-pattern/) to impliment event capturing, amongst other things. Repositories utilized by FLEX are located within `app/packages/`, and the repository used to capture events is contained within the directory `analytics_repository/` therein. More information on FLEX repositories may be found [here]().

<Aside type="note" title="TODO">
  Create a page dedicated to discussing the repository pattern with respect to
  FLEX. Possibly within a *Concepts* direcory.

At its core, `IAnalyticsRepository` is an [interface](https://dart.dev/language/extension-types#implements) that defines the structure that any service-specific event class should follow. It contains multiple methods, each representing a specific event. For example, the `checkoutBegin()` method represents when a user starts the checkout process in the FLEX app. For more information about pre-built events, see the [Supported Events](../52-supported-events) page.

Being a `supertype`, `IAnalyticsRepository` is service-agnostic and merely serves as a blueprint for future implementations. Currently, there are two implementations of `IAnalyticsRepository`:

- **GoogleAnalyticsRepository**: Representing [Google Analytics](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9267735?hl=en) and, more specifically, the [Firebase SDK](https://firebase.google.com/docs/analytics).
- **LoggerAnalyticsRepository**: Representing local event capturing.
